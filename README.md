# Data-Science

Some projects done by me in data science.

## Predicting Obesity

This is not the completed project as the final project got deleted. I only have the remnants of what was once a beautiful predictor made by a group of 3 of us. This was our first Machine Learning and Data Science project.

What was done:
- Cleaning of Data
- Libraries used: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
- Linear regression model

## Tensorflow Handwriting Detection and Keras Sentiment Analysis

These were part of online course videos I took in my free time. I got to understand further in depth through practice about how Tensorflow and Keras are used.
